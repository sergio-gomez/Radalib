# Radalib

Ada library and tools for the analysis of Complex Networks and more.


## Description

**Radalib** is a library originally developed by [*Sergio Gomez*](http://deim.urv.cat/~sergio.gomez) (sergio.gomez@urv.cat) and *Alberto Fernandez* (alberto.fernandez@urv.cat), which we have continuously been updating for our research within the [*Alephsys*](http://deim.urv.cat/~alephsys) research group, led by [*Alex Arenas*](http://deim.urv.cat/~alexandre.arenas), at [*Universitat Rovira i Virgili*](http://www.urv.cat/en/) (URV), Tarragona, since 2004. Previous experience showed that the continuous reuse of code was a painful task, thus we decided to be more structured and separate general purpose code (e.g. manipulation of networks and partitions) from the specific details of particular applications (e.g. Monte Carlo simulation of epidemic spreading). The result was the development of a general purpose library, mostly devoted to complex networks, and developed around abstract data types. This means the types are defined as "private", with public subprograms operating on them and encapsulating their implementations, thus allowing for future enhancements without having to modify the programs already using them. We could have used object oriented programming, but we believe polymorphism and inheritance are basically useless for this kind of applications.

The selected language was Ada, for several reasons: performance (it is a compiled language, not interpreted), readable code, support for abstract data types, strict data type system (allows catching many errors at compile time), advanced support of generics, high level support for concurrent programming (just in case it is needed), availability of high quality compilers for the main platforms (*Windows*, *Linux*, *MacOS*), and the confidence in your code when using it. The main drawback was the absence of code from other people we could reuse, but that was not a problem since we wanted full control and detailed understanding of every line of code used for our research.

**Radalib** is structured in three parts: *source* (the library itself), *test* and *tools*. *Tools* are programs which solve a certain problem, e.g. community detection, partitions comparison, network properties, connected components, file format conversion, etc., and which are basically mere interfaces to functionalities given by the library. The requests to make public implementations of some of the algorithms presented in our scientific papers led to the publication of **Radatools**, which are just executables for *Windows*, *Linux* and *MacOS* of some of the **Radalib** tools.

## Radalib library

The main packages and sets of packages in **Radalib** are:

- `Graphs`
    Graph type for weighted directed or undirected networks. Based on vectors of adjacency lists. Supposes the number of vertices is fixed. There are child packages for Algorithms, Modularities, Operations, Properties and Multilayer algorithms. The Graph Structure defines a public data type for fast graph access (e.g. in Monte Carlo simulations).

- `Finite_Disjoint_Lists`
    List_Of_Lists type used to handle general purpose partitions. Very efficient for most of the operations.

- `Disjoint_Sets`
    Disjoint_Set type used to handle partitions optimized for additive percolation processes.

- `Contingency_Tables`
    Contingency_Table type to compare partitions in List_Of_Lists form.

- `Linked_Lists`
    Linked_List type implementing doubly linked lists.

- `Stacks`
    Stack type for LIFO storage.

- `Queues`
    Queue type for FIFO storage.

- `Minheaps`
    Minheap type implementing binary heaps.

- `Trees`
    Tree type used to handle hierarchical structures.

- `Dendrograms`
    Dendrogram type is a particular case of Tree in which nodes have several additional properties, the most relevant being a height.

- `Modularities` and `Modularity_Optimization`
    Modularity type and algorithms for its optimization.

- `Utils` and `Arrays`
    Several packages with general purpose types and subprograms, with emphasys on one- and two-dimensional dynamic objects, strings, input-output and files manipulation.

- `Random_Numbers`
    Several random number generators.

- `Histograms`
    Histogram type for the calculation of linear and logarithmic histograms.

- `Statistics`
    Calculation of the main statistics measures.

- `Eps_Plots` and `Eps_Utils`
    Utils for the direct generation of EPS plots.

- `Chrono_Utils`
    Chronometer type to measure elapsed times.

Many of the packages are just instantiations of the generic packages above for elements of simple types such as Integer, Float, Double or String.
